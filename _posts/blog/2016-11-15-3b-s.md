## 3B's: Grow Where You Are

Few things have wider implications for our personal and community sustainability than what we eat and where it comes from. To encourage more residents to “grow where you are." OpenSMC has partnered with [Sustainable San Mateo County](http://www.sustainablesanmateo.org/ "Sustainable San Mateo County site") to help San Mateo County residents understand more about how they can participate in hyperlocal agriculture by keeping bees, chickens and other animals, and growing gardens on their property.

3B’s is one of the most recent projects to be developed by OpenSMC, a Code for America Brigade. We are a volunteer group of technologists, government employees, and civic-minded citizens, coming together to work on a variety of solutions to help the residents of San Mateo County. We are always looking for more people and ideas to advance that goal, so if you would like to play a part, regardless of your technical or civic experience, we invite you to join us at one of our weekly hack nights in Redwood City.
