## New Year, New Projects

Civic tech is moving to different parts of local government. TechCrunch posted this earlier today: [Tech is moving beyond cities to focus on civic engagement in every U.S. county](https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/14/moving-beyond-star-cities-to-focus-on-civic-engagement-in-every-u-s-county/)

It's good timing, as we've shipped a couple of project this year: [3B's](http://www.sustainablesanmateo.org/home/sustainability-resources/3bs/) and [Flu Clinic Finder](https://github.com/opensmc/smcfluclinics) (app on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.opensmc.fluclinic) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flu-clinics/id1166784917) too).

As the new year approaches, we're working on some new projects at [OpenSMC](http://opensmc.org/):

[Housing Platform](https://github.com/opensmc/housing-platform)

In collaboration with the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) and 21 Elements, we're working on a tool to help cities and counties reduce the amount of time and effort it takes to report on their affordable housing projects.

[Park Periscope](https://github.com/opensmc/park-periscope)

A project to collect attribute information about parks within San Mateo County.

Historical Maps of San Mateo County

In collaboration with the San Mateo County Department of Planning and Building, we're georeferencing 125 historical maps of San Mateo County from the 1800s through the 1970s. This project is so new, we don't have a page on GitHub yet!

Your project!

We'd love to have you join us at hack night any Tuesday (except 12/27) from 6 - 8:30pm at OpenGov [455 Charter St in Redwood City](https://www.google.com/maps/place/955+Charter+St,+Redwood+City,+CA+94063/@37.4859694,-122.2143179,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x808fa3046675f873:0x97f49b5442a9ddf4!8m2!3d37.4859652!4d-122.2121292). Come pitch your project, recruit people to your team, and get to work helping your community in San Mateo County.

We hope to see you soon!
