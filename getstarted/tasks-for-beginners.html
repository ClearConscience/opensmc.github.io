    <h2>Hello, Civic Hacking World!</h2>

    <p>First, to get the gist of what we’re working on, check out our list of projects to see what’s active. These are the kinds of initiatives you might eventually join. Then, read below to learn how you can hone the coding skills necessary to start hacking.</p>
    <p>At any time, if you have questions, join our <a href="https://opensmc-slack.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a> and post a comment in the #general-topics thread.</p>
    
    <h3>Learn About GitHub</h3>
    <p>Much of our work takes place on <a href="https://github.com/opensmc" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. If you’re not familiar with it, you may want to take some time to get up to speed. Check out <a href="https://guides.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub’s Tutorials</a>.</p>
    <p>For a higher-level overview of git, check out this <a href="https://try.github.io/" target="_blank">15-minute introduction.</a> Once you get started, this <a href="https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf" target="_blank">cheat sheet</a> might come in handy to remember key commands.</p>
    
    <h3>Open Some Data</h3>
    <h4>Get Data Released</h4>
    <p>Check out <a href="https://data.smcgov.org/" target="_blank">Open San Mateo County</a> to see what’s available in terms of local data. If you find something that’s missing, or out-of-date, contact the appropriate agency to politely let them know that they should release it. This might take some time and persistence, but you might also find that an agency is friendlier and more responsive than you could have imagined.</p>
    
    <h4>Improve Existing Data</h4>
    <p>Sometimes, an agency releases data in a form that isn’t archived and/or isn’t machine-readable. You can improve the world by correcting that. For example, Aaron (DC) created <a href="https://github.com/ajschumacher/dc_mayor_schedule" target="_blank">a web scraper to save the mayor’s schedule</a>, which was posted daily but not archived, and then made a small site to display that historical data. Or, Liz (DC) created <a href="https://github.com/lizmeister321/rebuilding-reentry?" target="_blank">a script to pull prison population data out of PDFs</a> posted monthly. Here is <a href="https://github.com/Quartz/bad-data-guide" target="_blank">a list of common problems</a> to look for.</p>
    <p>For web scraping, some popular tools include <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/" target="_blank">Beautiful Soup</a> for Python or <a href="http://www.nokogiri.org/" target="_blank">Nokigiri</a> for Node. For PDF extraction, <a href="http://tabula.technology/" target="_blank">Tabula</a> can be a good place to start.</p>
    
    <h3>Visualize Data, or Make It Actionable</h3>
    <p>If you’ve found a dataset, but aren’t sure what to do with it, it can be fun to play around with it and find the stories within the data. Consider how to make that data more interesting and informative to the general public. For example, Chris (DC) <a href="http://cmgiven.github.io/at-risk/" target="_blank">visualized the distribution of funding</a> for “at-risk" students in DC (<a href="https://github.com/cmgiven/at-risk" target="_blank">code here</a>). Chris also created <a href="https://cmgiven.github.io/bikeshare-odds/" target="_blank">a site to check your odds</a> of finding a bike at a Bikeshare dock (<a href="https://github.com/cmgiven/bikeshare-odds" target="_blank">code here</a>).</p>
    <p>If you’re interested in visualizations, <a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3</a> is a popular way to make a beautiful one using Javascript.</p>
    
    <h3>Make a Website Easier to Use</h3>
    <p>Sometimes, an agency provides an awesome service that’s difficult to access. In some cases, you can help that by creating an easier-to-use interface. For example, Emanuel (DC) created <a href="http://getdctrees.org/" target="_blank">a really simple tool</a> to request that Washington DC plant a tree at a certain address (<a href="https://github.com/emanuelfeld/tree-map" target="_blank">code here</a>).</p>

    <h3>Create a Twitter Bot</h3>
    <p>Building a Twitter bot is easier than you think, and it can be a great way to improve the visibility of some data while learning a bit of code. For example, Emanuel (DC) created <a href="https://twitter.com/booksfordc" target="_blank">a bot</a> that tweets out new additions to the Washington DC Library’s catalog (<a href="https://github.com/emanuelfeld/booksfordc" target="_blank">code here</a>).</p>
    <p>You can find frameworks for <a href="https://github.com/magsol/pybot" target="_blank">Python</a>, <a href="https://github.com/muffinista/chatterbot" target="_blank">Ruby</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/dariusk/examplebot" target="_blank">Node</a> to make this easier for you.</p>
