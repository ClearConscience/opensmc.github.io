## Fighting the Flu with Open Data

Each fall, the [County of San Mateo Health System](http://www.smchealth.org/) offers free and low-cost flu vaccine clinics for county residents. This year, OpenSMC has partnered with the Health System office to make information about these clinics available via the free Flu Clinics app for iOS and Android smartphones.

Flu Clinics provides a list of all scheduled free and low-cost clinics, displayed on a map of the county. Detailed information is available for each clinic, including the location, the cost (if any) for vaccinations, any age restrictions, and the dates and times during which the clinic is open. The app menu also provides several options for date ranges, so that you can find clinics that are open in the next few days, the next week, or the entire flu season. The app also supports all information in both English and Spanish. Clinic dates are currently available through December 2016, but future clinic dates and locations will automatically be available in the app as they are published.

You can download the application today on the [iOS App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flu-clinics/id1166784917) or on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.opensmc.fluclinic).

Flu Clinics is one of the most recent projects to be developed by OpenSMC, a Code for America brigade. We are a volunteer group of technologists, government employees, and civic-minded citizens, coming together to work on a variety of solutions to help the residents of San Mateo County. We are always looking for more people and ideas to advance that goal, so if you would like to play a part, regardless of your technical or civic experience, we invite you to join us at one of our [weekly hack nights](https://www.meetup.com/opensmc/) in Redwood City.
