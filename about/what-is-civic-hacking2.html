<p>At OpenSMC, we often refer to what we do as “civic hacking”. In its most basic sense, civic hacking means finding creative solutions for civic problems. We often focus on the technical side of things, but that is by no means our only approach.</p>
<p>For example, a low-tech civic hack could involve walking around a neighborhood with a clipboard to collect and share data not tracked by the city. Civic hackers often work with the local government and/or community organizations.</p>
